# Rust Embedded Drivers (RED) Book

In this book, we will learn how to create simple drivers for hardware devices that work within the embedded Rust ecosystem. 

## Prerequisites

- **Rust basics:** You should have a basic understanding of Rust. This book doesn't cover the fundamentals of the language.  If you're new to Rust, I recommend starting with the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can also find other resources [here](https://implrust.com/learn/beginner/).

This book is slightly more advanced than the others in the "impl Rust for" series and is intended for readers who already have some basic experience with embedded Rust.

If you're a beginner and haven't read the other books yet, you may want to start with one of the following:

- [esp32.implrust.com](https://esp32.implrust.com) - *impl Rust for ESP32* (uses the ESP32 Devkit v1)  
- [mb2.implrust.com](https://mb2.implrust.com) - *impl Rust for micro:bit v2*  
- [pico.implrust.com](https://pico.implrust.com) - *impl Rust for Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2350)*

 
## Other Learning Resources

- **[The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/index.html) :** This is a great resource if you're just getting into embedded Rust. You don't have to read it before jumping into this book, but it's a good place to start.   I'll do my best to explain things as we go, but if I miss something or don't cover it clearly, this book can really come in handy. One way or another, I definitely recommend giving it a read.
